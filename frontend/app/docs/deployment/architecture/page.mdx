# System Architecture

This document provides an overview of the core architecture behind the platform.  
Our design emphasizes **simplicity**, **scalability**, and **maintainability** while leveraging modern frameworks.

---

## High-Level Overview

The system is composed of three major layers:

1. **Frontend** – built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), providing a modern React-based UI.
2. **Backend** – powered by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Django Ninja](https://django-ninja.dev/) for high-performance APIs.
3. **Database** – a robust [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) instance for relational data storage.

Nextra powers the **documentation site**, allowing us to maintain developer-friendly docs in Markdown/MDX format.

---

## Components

### 🖥️ Frontend (Next.js)
- Client-side React components and server-side rendering (SSR).
- API interactions through JWT-based authentication.
- Static assets and docs served via [Nextra](https://nextra.site).

### ⚙️ Backend (Django + Django Ninja)
- Django provides the ORM, admin, and user management.
- Django Ninja adds fast, typed API endpoints.
- JWT authentication (via `ninja-jwt`) secures API requests.
- Business logic is split into **workspaces**, **files**, and **memberships**.

### 🗄️ Database (PostgreSQL)
- Centralized relational data store.
- Stores users, workspaces, memberships, and files.
- Transactions ensure data integrity.

### 📖 Documentation (Nextra)
- Developer docs live in the same repo as the application.
- Supports versioned, Markdown-based content.
- `_meta.js` files control navigation structure.
