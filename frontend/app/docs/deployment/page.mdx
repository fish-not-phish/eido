# Deployment Overview

This section provides a high-level view of how the platform is deployed and run in different environments.  
It covers the **frontend (Next.js)**, **backend (Django + Django Ninja)**, and **PostgreSQL database**, along with supporting infrastructure.

---

## Core Components

- **Next.js Frontend**
  - Runs in its own container or hosting environment.
  - Serves the user interface and interacts with the backend via REST APIs.
  - Built assets can be deployed to static hosting (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) or containerized.

- **Django + Django Ninja Backend**
  - Runs as an API server.
  - Handles authentication, workspace logic, and file management.
  - Exposed via a REST API secured with JWT.

- **PostgreSQL Database**
  - Persistent data store for users, workspaces, memberships, and files.
  - Typically runs in its own managed service or container.

- **Nextra Documentation**
  - Lives in the same repo as the application.
  - Bundled and deployed alongside the frontend.
  - Provides developer-facing docs (what youâ€™re reading now).

## Deployment Model

The platform is typically deployed using **Docker Compose** for local and simple deployments.  
In production, the same containers can be orchestrated with **Kubernetes** or run in managed services.
