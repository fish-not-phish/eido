# Architecture DSL Syntax

This DSL is used to describe cloud and system architecture diagrams in a simple, human-readable format.  
It supports **nodes, groups, properties, and connections**, with optional styling.

---

## Nodes

A **node** is the most basic building block.

**Example:**
```
compute [icon: aws-ec2]
```

- **compute** → unique node name  
- **icon: aws-ec2** → property (icon) attached to the node

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> You **must** declare a node with an icon before defining relationships using the `>` or `<` operators.
> Nodes **must have unique names**.

### Supported Properties
- `icon`: Name of an icon (e.g., `aws-ec2`)   
- `label`: Custom label text (use quotes if spaces, e.g., `"Main Server"`)

---

## Groups

A **group** is a container that can hold nodes and other groups.

**Example:**
```
Main VPC [icon: aws-vpc] {
  Server [icon: aws-ec2]
  Data [icon: aws-rds]
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Groups must also have unique names.

Groups can be **nested**:

```
VPC Subnet [icon: aws-vpc] {
  Main Server [icon: aws-vpc] {
    Server [icon: aws-ec2]
    Data [icon: aws-rds]
  }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Each group node **must** be given an icon, or the DSL will not properly parse it.

Groups support the same properties as nodes (`icon`, `label`, etc.).

---

## Properties

Properties are defined inside `[]` after a node or group.  

**Example:**
```
VPC [icon: aws-vpc] {
  Server [icon: aws-ec2]
  Data [icon: aws-rds]
}
```

---

## Connections

Connections represent relationships between nodes or groups.

**Example:**
```
Compute > Storage
```

### Connector Types
| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `>`    | Left-to-right arrow |
| `<`    | Right-to-left arrow |
| `<>`   | Bi-directional arrow |

### Labels on Connections
```
Storage > Server: Cache Hit
```

---

## Icons

You can use icons from multiple categories:

- **AWS Icons**
- **Google Cloud Icons**
- **Azure Icons**
- **Tech Logos**
- **General Icons**

(See the [Icons](../docs/icons) page for a full reference list.)
